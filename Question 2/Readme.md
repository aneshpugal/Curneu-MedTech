Excel file uploaded is the solution for the problem of clustering Signal_Database based on GENDER ,TEST TYPE , TYPE NAME based on their frequency since all these variables are categorical.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
My approach was understanding the distribution using python and filtering the dataset and creating another file for selected columns.                                                                                                                                                         
Newly created file is used for visualizing the specified variables.
